UMD Department of Transportation Services (DOTS) has a situation where increase in usage of the e-scooters might be a concern for campus sidewalks in the future.They have data and know these infractions are happening but couldnâ€™t assemble the data in useful format that provide useful information to enforce certain rules to improve the campus sidewalks student security. With the data provided by the DOTs, we decided to dive deep and provide an practical solutions with our findings.
